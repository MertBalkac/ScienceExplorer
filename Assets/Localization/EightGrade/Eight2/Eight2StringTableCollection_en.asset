    m_Localized: Interphase is the active portion of the cell cycle that includes
      the G1, S, and G2 phases, where the cell grows, replicates its DNA, and prepares
      for mitosis, respectively. Interphase was formerly called the "resting phase,"
      but the cell in interphase is not simply dormant.

    m_Localized: Prophase is the first stage of cell division in both mitosis and
      meiosis. Beginning after interphase, DNA has already been replicated when the
      cell enters prophase. The main occurrences in prophase are the condensation
      of the chromatin reticulum and the disappearance of the nucleolus.

    m_Localized: Metaphase is a stage of mitosis in the eukaryotic cell cycle in
      which chromosomes are at their second-most condensed and coiled stage.

    m_Localized: Anaphase is the stage of mitosis after the process of metaphase,
      when replicated chromosomes are split and the newly-copied chromosomes are
      moved to opposite poles of the cell.

    m_Localized: Telophase is the final stage in both meiosis and mitosis in a eukaryotic
      cell. During telophase, the effects of prophase and prometaphase are reversed.

    m_Localized: The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all forms
      of life. Every cell consists of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane; many
      cells contain organelles, each with a specific function.
