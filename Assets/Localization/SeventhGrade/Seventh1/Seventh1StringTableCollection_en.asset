      The digestive system is the organ system
      made up of the gastrointestinal tract, or GI tract (the hollow tube of organs
      running from the mouth to the anus), as well as the accessory digestive organs
      such as the teeth, tongue, salivary glands, liver, gallbladder and pancreas.
      The function of the digestive system is to break down and absorb food, and
      to excrete waste products.'

      The mouth is the beginning of the digestive tract
      and vital for speech. Structures of the mouth include the lips, tongue, hard
      and soft palates, salivary glands, gums, and teeth. The mouth is divided into
      two sections. The vestibule, located between the cheeks and teeth, and the
      oral cavity proper, which is inside the teeth.

    m_Localized: 'ESOPHAGUS


      The esophagus connects the pharynx (immediately
      located after the mouth) and the stomach. Typically around 10 inches long,
      it descends behind the trachea and in front of the spinal column in the neck,
      passing behind the left lung to pierce the diaphragm. The esophagus transports
      food to the stomach for digestion.


      Function: The esophagus transports
      food to the stomach for digestion.'

      The liver is located in the upper right section of
      the abdominal cavity, below the diaphragm and above the stomach. The liver
      has two lobes, the left and right lobes, which are divided into segments. The
      liver plays many critical roles, including producing bile and cholesterol,
      balancing glucose levels, and filtering blood.

    m_Localized: 'STOMACH


      The stomach is the main digestive organ in the
      body. Shaped like a J and located in the upper left region of the abdominal
      cavity, it receives undigested food from the esophagus, breaks it down with
      digestive juices, and then empties into the small intestine. The inner lining
      of the stomach is protected by a layer of mucosa tissue.


      Function:
      The stomach is the main digestive organ in the body, and receives undigested
      food from the esophagus, breaks it down with digestive juices, and then empties

      The small intestine is located in the abdomen.
      It receives partially digested food from the stomach, then secretes digestive
      enzymes and absorbs nutrients as food travels through its folds. In all, the
      large intestine can be 15 feet or more in length. It has three sections: the
      duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.

      The large intestine receives digested food
      from the ileum (the last part of the small intestine), then extracts nutrients
      and water and prepares it for excretion. The large intestine includes the cecum,
      appendix, colon, rectum and anal canal. The colon has three sections: ascending
      colon, transverse colon, and descending colon.

      The rectum is part of the large intestine, located
      between the sigmoid colon and the anal canal. The rectum is a muscular tube
      about 5 inches long that receives and holds waste from the sigmoid colon. When
      there is enough pressure in the rectum, nerves in the rectum signal the brain
      and the rectal muscles contract.


      Function: The rectum receives fecal
      material from the colon, stores it until defecation.'

      The skull is the name for the bones that make up

      bones, ear ossicles, and a hyoid bone. The opening at the bottom of the skull,
      the foramen magnum, is the hole through which the spinal cord connects to the
      brain.


      Function: The purpose of the skull is to protect the brain and
      provide a structure for muscles of the scalp and face.'

      column, or spinal column.

      shoulder to the two bones of the forearm, the radius and ulna. The humerus
      supports movement in the arm and shoulder.

      The radius, or radial bone, is one of the two long

      it articulates with the both the humerus and ulna, to the thumb side of the
      wrist, where it articulates with the carpal bones, and the head of the ulna.


      Function:
      The radius allows the forearm and hand to pronate and supinate, flex and extend
      at the elbow, and adduct, abduct, extend, flex, and circumduct the wrist.'

      The ulna is one of the two bones of the forearm. It

      the forearm. It forms the elbow joint with the humerus and radius. Although
      the ulna travels to the wrist, it is not technically part of the wrist joint.
      The ulna helps in pronation and supination of the forearm and hand.
