    m_Localized: 'ANIMAL CELL


      Animal cells contain a wide variety of organelles
      to help them carry out their functions.


      Function: A cell is the basic
      structural and functional unit of an organism and is often called the "building
      block of life."'

      The nucleus is a large membrane-bound organelle
      that contains the genetic information of eukaryotic cells.


      Function:
      The nucleus stores information in the form of DNA and controls the activities
      of the cell by selectively transcribing RNA, which exits via the nuclear pores.'

    m_Localized: 'PLASMA MEMBRANE


      The plasma membrane is a lipid bilayer,
      which is mostly composed of phospholipid molecules that have polar and nonpolar
      parts.


      Function: The plasma membrane surrounds and protects the cytoplasm
      while allowing the passage of certain materials in and out of the cell.'

      The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is
      a network of membrane-enclosed sacs and tubules in a cell. It extends from
      the outer nuclear membrane throughout the cytoplasm.


      Function: Ribosomes
      deposit proteins into the lumen of the rough ER, where they can be modified.
      Transport vesicles then take the modified proteins to the nearby Golgi body,
      where they are processed further and sorted for transport.'

      The Golgi body (Golgi apparatus, Golgi
      complex) is a membrane-bound organelle located in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic
      cells. Animal cells usually have one or several Golgi bodies, whereas plant
      cells can have hundreds.


      Function: The Golgi body receives proteins,
      synthesized by ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum, via transport
      vesicles. Enzymes in the cisternae modify these proteins and pack them into
      vesicles that bud off the Golgi body and transport the proteins to different
      areas in the cell.'

      The centrosome is a membrane-less organelle
      in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic animal cells. It acts as the main microtubule-organizing
      center (MTOC) and plays a key role in cell division.


      Function: The
      centrosome organizes microtubules, maintaining cell shape and enabling chromosome
      separation during mitosis. It contains two centrioles that duplicate and move
      to opposite poles to form the mitotic spindle.'

      products from the smooth ER throughout the cell."

      The cell wall of the plant cell is external to
      the plasma membrane. Plants can have three cell wall layers: a thin and flexible
      primary cell wall composed of polysaccharides, a thicker secondary cell wall
      composed of cellulose, and an outer middle lamella composed of pectins.


      Function:
      The cell wall protects the cell; maintains its shape; and helps facilitate
      the passage of water, nutrients, gases, and wastes into and out of the cell.'

      The central vacuole is a large membrane-bound
      organelle located in the cytoplasm of plant cells. In most mature plant cells,
      there is one central vacuole that takes up 30 to 80% of the cell''s volume.


      Function:
      The vacuole stores much of the plant cell''s water, storage molecules, and
      enzymes.'

      Chloroplasts are specialized, membrane-bound
      organelles located in the cytoplasm of plant cells that carry out photosynthesis.
      Plant cells can have anywhere between one and a hundred chloroplasts, which
      move around the cell and can divide to replicate themselves.


      Function:
      Chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis within plant cells. They are also involved
      in the plant''s synthesis of fatty acids and amino acids and its immune response.'
